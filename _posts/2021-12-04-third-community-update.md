Hello fellow space explorer! 📡

It's official, we have a lead designer and a community manager joining the team! She will present herself here in the next days, official join will be 22th of this month.👩‍🎓

Some unexpected events are retarding our schedule but we're still here and working hard. The very first job of our new lead designer will be to produce a mock of the user interface and that will be disclosed here publicly, so you can start to get an idea of what the game will look like.🎆

We like transparency, we want to you to know what is going on and want you to know exactly how it is proceeding because in trust we trust!📑

Happy exploring and see you soon!

The founders.
