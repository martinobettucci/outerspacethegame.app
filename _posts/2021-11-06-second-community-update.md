Hello fellow space explorer! ðŸ›°

We are a little late on schedule this month. We found the artists who will take care of the graphics and the style of the game: some artworks will be released soon so stay in touch.

During the next months we will disclosure some game mechanics and you don't want to miss that !ðŸš§

Building such a game is as big as the great outer space we want you all to explore, forgive us for such a low content so far but stay assured we are on tracks!!ðŸš‚

Have a great month and subscribe to the ATOM feed of this site.

The founders.
