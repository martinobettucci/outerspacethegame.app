# The second-market stores

There are two stores for the game assets: public store and private stores.  
The assets from public and private stores are not fungible between the markets: you can **not** sell a public store asset on the private store, neighter you can do the opposite.  
For the sake of explanation, we will use acronyms for those use-cases from now on:
 - external-game-assets (EGA): the assets available and exchanged on the public store.
 - internal-game-assets (IGA): the assets you bought or sold from the private store or minted during in-game.
  
You will need to claim a IGA private assets when you buy an EGA public asset from the public stores.  
You will need to claim a EGA public assets from an IGA private assets you want to sell.  

The reasons why such approch was retained are explained later on this document.

## Public stores

The public NFT stores collections serves as the entry and leaving door for players, more about that on the (licence)[/economics/game-economics-licences.html] page.  
Excepted for the initial whitelist selling for each universe, new players are encouraged to buy assets from the selling current or leaving players.  
Public store are publicly available NFT stores like Rarible, Opensea, ... the buy and selling tokens and amounts depends on the platform the selling players enlists them.

## Private stores

The private stores are the stores hosted in-game and allows players to trade the assets between players.  
In opposition to public stores, private stores **do not** allows players to trade on any token other then the in-game tokens.  
If you wont to sell your assets for other tokens outside the scope of OSTG, you have to sell them on public stores.  
Prices are regulated on the private stores and will have max/min depending on the social game economy to avoid spoils and encourage fair trades thus increase competitiveness and mastered curve for newcomers.  
Since this arguments relates to the game mechanics instead of the game economics, you uare invited to keep the reading on the [corresponding game mechanics page](/mechanics/game-mechanics-stores.html).
