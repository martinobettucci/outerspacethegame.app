# The second-market stores

There are two stores for the game assets: public store and private stores.  
The assets from public and private stores are not fungible between the markets: you can **not** sell a public store asset on the private store, neighter you can do the opposite.  
For the sake of explanation, we will use acronyms for those use-cases from now on:
 - external-game-assets (EGA): the assets available and exchanged on the public store.
 - internal-game-assets (IGA): the assets you bought or sold from the private store or minted during in-game.
  
You will need to claim a IGA private assets when you buy an EGA public asset from the public stores.  
You will need to claim a EGA public assets from an IGA private assets you want to sell.  

The reasons why such approch was retained are explained later on this document.

## Public stores

The public NFT stores collections serves as the entry and leaving door for players, more about that on the [licence](/economics/game-economics-licences.html) page.  
Excepted for the initial whitelist selling for each universe, new players are required to buy assets from the selling current or leaving players.  
Public store are publicly available NFT stores like Rarible, Opensea, ... the buy and selling tokens and amounts depends on the platform the selling players enlists them.

## Private stores

The private stores are the stores hosted in-game and allows players to trade the assets between players.  
In opposition to public stores, private stores **do not** allows players to trade on any token other then the in-game tokens.  
If you wont to sell your assets for other tokens outside the scope of OSTG, you have to sell them on public stores.  
Prices are regulated on the private stores and will have max/min depending on the social game economy to avoid spoils and to encourage fair trades thus increase competitiveness and a mastered curve for newcomers.  
Since this arguments relates to the game mechanics instead of the game economics, you are invited to keep the reading on the [corresponding game mechanics page](/mechanics/game-mechanics-stores.html).

# How does the second-maket store serves its purpose

The second-market store IS the most important piece of the game economy.  
The game will have two parallel running economies: in-game and public.  
  
## private in-game store(s)
 
By having a separate list of private stores, it is possible for every player and in-game to create their own's selling whatever item they own for every in-game token they would like.  
As OSTG is a social metaverse universe, a player resource have to be physically on a planet owned by the seller in order to make a trade: this would be very impractical to achieve via public stores.  
The in-game economy allows players to retrieve some resources to continue exploring the universe, harvest and build their empire.  
Simply said, the private stores *are there to achieve immersion* in the game universe.  

## public store
The public store allows players to sell their tokens for other not-in-game cryptocurrencies and possibly make a profit.  
Also, by selling to non-players, it allows the universe to be populated and increase immersion.  
Simply said, the public store *allows players to join and leave* the game.
