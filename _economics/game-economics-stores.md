# The stores

There are two stores for the game assets: public store and private stores.  
The assets from public and private stores are not fungible between the markets: you can **not** sell a public store asset on the private store, neighter you can do the opposite.  
For the sake of explanation, we will use acronyms for those use-cases from now on:
 - external-game-assets (EGA): the assets available and exchanged on the public store.
 - internal-game-assets (IGA): the assets you bought or sold from the private store or minted during in-game.
  
You will need to claim a IGA private assets when you buy an EGA public asset from the public stores.  
You will need to claim a EGA public assets from an IGA private assets you want to sell.  

The reasons why such approch was retained are explained later on this docu

## Public stores
The public NFT store collections serves as the entry and leaving door for players, more about that on the (licence)[] page.  
New players are encouraged to buy assets from the leaving players.  
Public store are publicly available NFT stores like Rarible, Opensea, ... the buy and selling tokens and amounts depends on the platform the former players enlists them.

## Private stores
The private stores are the store hosted in-game and allows players to trade the assets between players.  
Opposed to public stores, private stores **do not** allows players to trade on any token other then the in-game tokens.  
If you wont to sell your assets for other tokens, you have to sell them on public stores by your own to non players.  
Prices are regulated on the private store and have max/min depending on the social game economy to avoid spoilers and encourage fair trades thus increase competitiveness and mastered curve for newcomers.
