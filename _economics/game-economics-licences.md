### How to buy a licence to play

Initially, there will be a closed whitelist selling of generated assets for each and new universe.  
  
You can enter the game by buying a resource needed to play a universe either from the whitelist selling of from the existing players.
> In fact, we think OSTG will be the very first licence based blockchain MMO ever built.  
Unless you own one already, every game assets you buy from our (or affiliated) stores will airdrops you a licence to play in the universe the asset belongs.  
  
We encourage second-market gaming and in fact you can sell your assets all at once by forfeiting your licence.  
> Again, we think OSTG will probably be the very first full-digital second-market friendly on-line game ever built.

## A licence to play?

Whenever you buy a game asset (from us or another player), you'll be issued personally a licence to you to play the game for the universe the asset belongs.
Every personnal licence *CANNOT BE TRANSFERED* but can surely be forfeited.  
If you want to sell the game in the second-market, you just have to forfeit your licence and we will put all your assets on the second-hand marked on your behalf.  
Having a licence also entitles you to sell your assets on our (or affilited) stores.  
> A licence takes the form of a special type of NFT minted explicitely for the player wallet.

## Validity of a licence
Every personnal licence is valid for a game universe and will be valid life-time. As long as you have your universe licence, you can keep on playing on the entitled game universe forever.  
Occasionnally, licenced players on a universe might get a free licence for another universe: the conditions will be shared on the community server whenever it applys.  
If you don't understand what a game universe is, have a read to the [game mechanics introduction](/economics/game-mechanics-intro.html).

## Functions of the licence

All in-game mechanics are locked to player having a valid active game licence in their wallet to play.  
It is just as simple as that.  
> All work and no licence to play makes the player a dull boy
Forfeiting the licence (which is the equivalent as selling your game to the second market) is also available only to those having a valid licence (for obious reasons).

### What happens when I forfeit my licence?

We burn your licence forever. All your assets are put on sold on the second-market.  
You'll be entitled to reclaim the gains from those sellings accordingly to the terms of services of the second-market.
