# Introduction to OSTG economics

OuterSpace-The gamE- (OSTG from now on) is a on-line social gaming experience.  
Thought it is driven by NFT, TOKENS and atomic transactions for its mechanics, **the blockchain is merely the hardware layer the game engine relies on** to make its the magic and distribute the charge.  
This is very befenicial for us and for our players as there won't be any point of failure of the "back-end" experience.  
Allows us to explain:
 - There is no centralised server to be maintained (or to be shut down).
 - There is no risk one party may fail to pay the fees to a centralised infrastructure as all players are paying the fees while playing to the distributed blockchain network.
 - There is no need to pay for backups as blockchains stores informations forever and on every node.
 - Having no enstablished address, there won't be any limitations on the players allowed to play.

As for the "front-end", the client will be available open-source to ensure its redondance and availability and hosted on our website as long as possible.

## How to become a player

We insists as the blockchain being just the hardware running layer of the game: there won't be any TOKEN you can trade off the game while playing: __this is NOT a farming blockchain game__.  
If you want to understand why we chose to do so, have a read to our [whitepaper](/whitepaper).  
That being said, we choose to monetize the game development using an innovative (in the blockchain market) yet very effective  already proven way: dead simple licence to play selling.  

## What can I do as a player

Once you are entitled to play, you are free to play and collect ressources for your expension and conqueral needs.  
Should you have spare resources you do not need anymore, you can put on the second-market store for others (new?) players to enjoy or forfeit your game and let new players join by buying back what was once yours.  
You are also entitled to reclaim royalities on every sell for the assets you minted (forever) or bought (with some limitations and for a limited time) in your playthrough should they reach the public second-market store: 
 - even if they are sold not by you.
 - even if you are not a player anymore.
[Read about how the second-market store here](/economics/game-economics-store.html)
  
# How the game is founded

Excepted for the very first universe ever which will be sold with a different [procedure and schedule described here](/economics/game-economics-presale.html), there will be a closed whitelist selling of generated assets for each and new universe.  
The initially minted list of assets is meant to fund the game commitee with treasury: just like when you buy a game from an on-line platform, we take the credits to refund our research and develpment in the game.  
There will be **only one** initial mint of generated assets from us for each new universe and we will *never* mint new assets for a universe *ever* again: *we want the players to mint the rest of the universe by playing*.  
We will ensure we won't be able to mint a batch of assets no more then one-time per universe by publicly available smart-contract code who will effectively locks us out the possibility to do otherwise.  
There are also some fees that goes to the game commitee concerning the second-market stores in/out, read the details on the dedicated page.

## How is this sustainable?

The whitelist selling will enstablish the first players in the universe.
As new players are required to buy assets to receive a licence, existing players are encouraged to mint new in-game assets by game design.  
Current players selling assets allows new players to join, increasing competitiveness thus creating balance.  
When a universe is too balanced, a new one will be issued.  
Late players of high balance universe will likely migrate to the newests umbalanced universes, thus older universes keeps on living for old time player as they would likely have the treasury to go on playing.  
There won't be any possibility to migrate assets nor any in-game token from one universe to another, every time players change of universe they have to start fresh.    

# And that's all, folks.

The game economics is surprisingly simple.  
Sure, you can read more on the dedicated pages as there are some complexities but everything is just there:
 - We fund creating a game universes by selling an initial batch of items, which in return allows players to settle.
 - The settlers explores, trades, conquers and by doing so they mint new in-game resources.
 - The players eventually claim public assets from private assets (read more on the second-market TOS) to sell them to new players.
 - New players join the game by buying the public assets from the second-market public store.
 - New players claims private assets from public assets in order to play in-game.
 - The game commitee get some tresury from each claim actions of the players both ways.
 - As the players claims the private assets from public assets, royalities of the assets are attributed to the current and former players from the game tresory.
  
Happy exploring fellow explorer!
